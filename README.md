# ML-project---Identify-Regime-Shift-in-Stock-Market
📊 Excited to share My Latest self-motivated Side Project 📈📉

A deep dive into identifying market regime shifts using Machine Learning!  [Source code included]

🌟 Inspired by an ongoing machine learning project at Wealth Management Cube Ltd, I have executed data cleaning, visualization,  feature selection, modeling and verification in this side project. Here's some key highlights:



🔍 Market Regime Classification:

Leveraged the power of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for classifying market regimes within the S&P 500, aiming to capture distinct behavioral patterns.



💼 The Significance of Log Returns: 

Chose log returns over simple/cumulative returns, ensuring stationary, additive measures for comparisons, and minimizing asset price level influences.



📉 Model Exploration: Experimented with various models like Gaussian Mixture Models, Greedy Gaussian Segmentation, LSTM, XGBoost, and more. This exploration amplified my insights into each model's unique attributes and potential constraints.



🔮 Future Endeavors:

🕵️‍♂️Flexible Feature Integration: Delve deeper the integration of features like candlestick patterns to refine model precision.



📊 Decoding Short-Term Market Trends: Addressing the complex short-term trends remains a challenge I'm eager to tackle



🔄 Exploring Alternative Models: The Markov AR Switching model and others may provide more insights into market dynamics.



📈 Merging ML & Trading Strategies: Eager to combine ML with robust trading strategies based on market regimes.
